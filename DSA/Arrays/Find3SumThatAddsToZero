3 Sum : Find triplets that add up to a zero

Input:
 nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output:
 [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]


Brute Force Approach
Using 3 for loops
    for i - n
        for j-> i+1 to n
            for k -> j+1 to n
                if num[i]+num[j]+num[k] == 0
                    print anwer


Better Approach
    using 2 loops

        for i to n
            for j -> i+1 to n
                set to store the anwers
                    third value = - (Arr[i]+arr[j])
                        if it is present in set store the answer in sorted way
                        and add the jth element in set


optimal approach
    using 2 pointer approach
sort the array
i will be at 0 ,
j will be at i+1
and k will be at n
    for i =0 to n
        if(i>0 && arr[i]==arr[i-1] continue
        j= i+1 and  k = n-1;
        while (j<k){
            sum = arr[i]+arr[k]+arr[j]
            if(sum>0)
                k--
             else if (sum<0)
                j++

                else {
                    j++,
                    k---
                    do it while we do not have different value for j and k
                }
