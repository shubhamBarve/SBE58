Example 1:
Input Format:
 A = [4, 2, 2, 6, 4] , k = 6
Result:
 4
Explanation:
 The subarrays having XOR of their elements as 6 are  [4, 2], [4, 2, 2, 6, 4], [2, 2, 6], [6]



Brute Force Approach

    2 for loops
    same as we did to find the subarrays


Optimal Approach

    xr = arr[i]
     int x = xr ^ k;
     if x is there in map
