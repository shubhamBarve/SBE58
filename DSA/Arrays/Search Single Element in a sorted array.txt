We need to find the element which appears only once
all the other element appears more than one time

and the array is sorted

Input Format:
 arr[] = {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,5,5,6,6}
Result: 4

Brute Force approach

    traverse through array
     update miniCount with the count whichever is less


optimal approach

consider the edge cases for 1 and first element as well as the element which is at last
    apply binary search
        if(mid is not eqal to mid+1 and mid-1 )
            we found the elem

         if(mid
